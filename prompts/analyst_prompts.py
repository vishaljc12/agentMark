Prompts for the Analyst Agent in Market Mix Modeling
"""

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a Marketing Analytics Expert specializing in Market Mix Modeling (MMM).
Your task is to analyze marketing spend data and prepare it for modeling.

Follow these steps precisely:
1. Load and clean the data
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Analyze relationships between marketing channels and sales
4. Apply adstock transformations to marketing spend variables
5. Prepare data for modeling

Be thorough, precise, and use best practices in data analysis and visualization.
"""

ANALYZE_DATA_PROMPT = """
Analyze the marketing spend data thoroughly:

1. Perform and document the following analyses:
   - Summary statistics for each column
   - Check for missing values and outliers
   - Visualize time series trends for sales and each marketing channel
   - Create distribution plots for all variables
   - Analyze seasonality patterns in sales data
   - Calculate correlation between sales and marketing channels

2. Generate insights about:
   - Which channels show the strongest correlation with sales?
   - Are there any noticeable time-lag effects?
   - What are the spending patterns across channels?
   - How do sales respond to changes in marketing spend?

3. Prepare visualizations including:
   - Time series plots of sales and marketing spend by channel
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Scatter plots of sales vs. each marketing channel
   - Distribution of spend across channels

Present your findings in a clear, structured format with key insights highlighted.
"""

ADSTOCK_TRANSFORMATION_PROMPT = """
Apply adstock transformations to the marketing spend variables:

1. For each marketing channel, implement adstock transformation with the specified decay parameters.
2. Evaluate different decay rates within the provided ranges to find optimal values.
3. Compare the correlation of original and transformed variables with sales.
4. Visualize the transformed variables against sales to demonstrate the impact.
5. Document the optimal decay rates found and reasoning.

Adstock transformation captures the carryover effect of advertising, where the impact of advertising extends beyond the initial period.
The formula is: Adstocked_Spend(t) = Spend(t) + Decay_Rate * Adstocked_Spend(t-1)

For each channel, find the decay rate that maximizes correlation with sales.
"""

DATA_PREPARATION_PROMPT = """
Prepare the data for marketing mix modeling:

1. Create train/test split using the specified ratio
2. Apply any necessary transformations based on the modeling approach:
   - For log-log models: Apply log transformation to sales and spend variables
   - For semi-log models: Apply log transformation to relevant variables
   - For linear models: Consider scaling/normalizing variables
3. Create a baseline sales estimate
4. Prepare a dataset with all transformed variables ready for modeling
5. Generate summary statistics and visualizations of the prepared data

Ensure the data is properly structured for the modeling agent to build MMM models.
